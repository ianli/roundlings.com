This is the website of [The Roundlings](http://www.roundlings.com) by [Ian Li](http://www.ianli.com).


## Early history

I drew the first Roundlings character, the blue bunny, in October 2011.
The character was inspired by the picture of a [sad baby swinging in a pink bunny suit](http://weknowmemes.com/2011/10/sad-baby-swinging-in-a-pink-bunny-suit/).

A couple of years later, in February 2014, I drew a collection of Valentine's Day cards for my girlfriend.
The cards featured five more Roundlings characters: a cat, a fox, a chicken, a rhino, and a dinosaur.
Along with the bunny, the characters represented the six colors of the rainbow.

Later, I added a seventh Roundling, an alien/astronaut. Inspired by the characters in [The Sandman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)) series (which I recently finished reading), I attributed personalities to the seven characters to match those in the series. I will leave it up to you to figure out how they match.


## Goals

This website will serve as a repository of illustrations, comics, writings, and interactive that feature the Roundlings.
