# About
{: .text-center}

Roundlings are cute and cuddly characters created by Ian Li.

This website is a repository of illustrations, comics, and writings that feature the Roundlings.

## Early history

The first Roundling I drew was the blue bunny in October 2011.
The character was inspired by a picture of a baby swinging in a pink bunny suit.

In February 2014, I drew a bunch of Valentine's Day cards that featured five new Roundlings: a cat, a fox, a chicken, a rhino, and a dinosaur.
Along with the bunny, the characters represented the six colors of the rainbow. Later, I added a seventh Roundling, an alien/astronaut.

Hi, I'm Ian Li! I love drawing.
I hope you enjoy the Roundlings as much as I enjoyed drawing them.

I live in California with my wife and daughter.
When I'm not drawing, I like to watch movies, go dancing, create websites, eat spicy foods.
