# About
{: .text-center}

Roundlings are cute and cuddly characters created by Ian Li.

This website is a repository of illustrations, comics, and writings that feature the Roundlings.

## Early history

The first Roundling I drew was the blue bunny in October 2011.
The character was inspired by a picture of a [sad baby swinging in a pink bunny suit](http://weknowmemes.com/2011/10/sad-baby-swinging-in-a-pink-bunny-suit/).

In February 2014, I drew a bunch of Valentine's Day cards that featured five more Roundlings characters: a cat, a fox, a chicken, a rhino, and a dinosaur.
Along with the bunny, the characters represented the six colors of the rainbow. Later, I added a seventh Roundling, an alien/astronaut.

I attributed personalities to the seven Roundlings that were inspired by the characters in [The Sandman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)) series (which I had recently finished reading).

## Who is Ian Li?

Hi, I'm Ian Li! I love drawing a lot.
I hope you enjoy the Roundlings as much as I enjoyed drawing them.

I live in California with my wife and daughter.
When I'm not drawing, I like to watch movies, go dancing, create websites, eat spicy foods.
