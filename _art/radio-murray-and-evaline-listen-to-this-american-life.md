[Murray](/2014/10/22/murray.html) and [Evaline](/2014/10/28/evaline.html)
love listening to the radio when driving.
One of their favorite shows is [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/).
They like the show because of the wide range of topics that it covers.

Here are some of their favorite episodes related to traveling and driving:

* [Hit The Road](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/494/hit-the-road)
* [Rest Stop](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/388/rest-stop)

This drawing is inspired by two comic book panels.
The first panel is from the _Sandman #45_ pencilled by Jill Thompson.
It shows the characters [Dream and Delirium driving](https://twitter.com/ianli/status/530566418903728129) to find one of their brothers, Destruction.
In the back seat is Matthew who nervously gives Delirium driving directions.

The second panel is from _Nation X #1_ drawn by Michael Allred.
It shows the characters Wolverine and Nightcrawler driving while listening to _This American Life_.
Marvel and This American Life [collaborated to turn the comic book panel into a poster](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/blog/2010/11/this-american-life-x-men-poster).
