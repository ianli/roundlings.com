[Carson](/2014/10/25/carson.html)'s favorite public radio show is [Car Talk](http://www.cartalk.com/), a radio show about automobiles and automotive repair.
She loves the humorous banter and insightful advice of the two hosts, brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi, known as _Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers_.

This drawing is dedicated to Tom Magliozzi.
Your big laugh and helpful advice about automobiles made many Saturday mornings bright and cheery.
