[Herbert](/2014/10/23/herbert.html)'s favorite public radio show is [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/), a radio show about science, philosophy, and human experience.
He likes the show because it illuminates scientific phenomena and shows how science is part of our everyday life.
Some of his favorite episodes are:

* [Musical Language](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91512-musical-language/) - This episode examines the line between language and music.
* [A World Without Words](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91729-a-world-without-words/) - Radiolab interviews neurologist Jill Bolte Taylor about her experience when a stroke left her unable to speak.
* [Colors](http://www.radiolab.org/story/211119-colors/) - One of the stories is the curious case of the lack of mention of the color blue in __The Odyssey__ and __The Iliad__.
